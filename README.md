WinForm, WPF, etc. It will facilitate creating fully localized applications providing both RTL and 
LTR reading orders as well as calendars not fully supported in .NET framework (PersianCalendar). 
The initial [article][1] was first published in April 2006 on CodeProject website and the WPF 
version was released soon after WPF was still in early versions and was one of the pioneers 
DatePicker controls provided on WPF platforms.
